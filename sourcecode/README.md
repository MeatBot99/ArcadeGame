# Bug Avoider
This is a clone of the classic **Frogger** arcade game. It gets its name from something we all should strive to achieve.
# To Run This Program:
(Window OS)
First of all, ensure you have a keyboard.
Download the files by clicking the green rectangle at the top right of this element.
Click on the *Download zip* button.
Access the **ArcadeGame-master-zip** file from where ever you save your downloaded files to.
Right click on the folder and **Extract All**.
Once the files have been unzipped, navigate through the folders *ArcadeGame-master*>*sourcecode*.
Then open the index.html file and the game will launch.
# Directions:
Choose a character to represent you in the game. Then press the _Confirm_ button.
You will be presented with a game screen now.
Your objective is to jump in the healing river _water_ **10 times** to win the game.
Use the **arrow keys** to navigate this harrowing journey.
Be careful though, for there are a seemingly infinite amount of _evil bugs_ that will take your life away the instant they touch you.
Fortunately you have 3 lives, so there is a little room for error.
