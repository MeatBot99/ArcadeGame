#Bug Avoider#
This is a clone of the classic **Frogger** arcade game. It gets its name from something we all should strive to achieve.
#Directions#
Choose a character to represent you in the game. Then press the _Confirm_ button.
You will be presented with a game screen now.
Your objective is to jump in the healing river _water_ **10 times** to win the game.
Use the **arrow keys** to navigate this harrowing journey.
Be careful though, for there are a seemingly infinite amount of _evil bugs_ that will take your life away the instant they touch you.
Fortunately you have 3 lives, so there is a little room for error.
#Dependencies#
 -keyboard (no touch support yet)
 -javascript (needs to be able to run)
 -keen sense of timing(to avoid the bugs)
